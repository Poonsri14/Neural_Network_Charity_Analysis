# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Deep ML

## Overview of the analysis

To use machine learning and neural networks with the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup and to help the foundation predict where to make investments 


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
successful

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
everything, but successful

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
EIN and Name

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model


How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
2 layers 1=80, 2=30 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
 accuracy: 0.7245

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
accuracy: 0.7886 

## Summary: 

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
